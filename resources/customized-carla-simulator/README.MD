## MacOS

At this time macOS is not natively supported by CARLA and therefore the CARLA binaries that we provide also do not support macOS. It is recommended to create a dual-boot to either Linux or Windows in order to setup CARLA for the course.

### Resources: 

- Install Windows on your Mac with Boot Camp : https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201468
- Dual-Boot between Ubuntu and MacOS : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation

There are other online resources that can assist you with creating a dual boot for Windows or Ubuntu. Feel free to search for these sites on your prefered web browser.

## Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines are discouraged as they generally do not have the necessary hardware virtualization to run the Unreal Engine (which CARLA is based on). It is recommended to install Linux or Windows directly as a dual boot in order to setup CARLA for the course.
