# Self-Driving Car Projects

<img src="https://github.com/afondiel/Self-Driving-Cars-Specialization/blob/main/Course1-Introduction-to-Self-Driving-Cars/resources/w1/img/m0-intro.png?raw=true" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

## Overview

I was amazed by this project of [Andrea Palazzi](https://github.com/ndrplz) where he shares all the projects of[ Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013).


I echoed the same for the [Self-Driving Car Specialization](https://github.com/afondiel/Self-Driving-Cars-Specialization) of Faculty of Appied Science and Engineering of [University of Toronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/) that I took recently on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars).

## Motivation 

In today industry, gaining access to the vital knowledge required in the self-driving car market proves challenging due to the strict guarding of technology and advancements by the key industry participants.

Here @diesimo-ai, we believe that in order to speed up the self-driving development process, we must support the idea of sharing more opensource resources and valuable projects. 

I hope you find this helpful.
